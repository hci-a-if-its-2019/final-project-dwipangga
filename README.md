# Crappy Design Project

Welcome to **_Crappy Design Project_**, yet another HCI final project.

![Crappy Banner](img/banner.png)
**Crappy Design Project** is brought to you by Dwipangga. We will ~~_talk_~~ criticize a website with ~~_crappy_~~ **bad** design which significantly affects the user while interacting with the website. 

Sounds boring? Okay, we admit it :)

Let's add some boreness level by introducing ourselves in boring way.

## Our Target

Ah... We're forget to tell what kind of website will we criticize for this project. Now, meet our target...

![viraindo.com](img/viraindo.png)

Can you guess it? No idea? Ok, we will introduce it for you.

> **viraindo.com** is a website of a computer store which located at Mangga Dua Mall, Jakarta. **viraindo.com** is owned by Vira Jaya Computer. They provide the information about the price of computer parts they sell. As a big computer store, viraindo has a large collection of computer parts. This site was created to ease the customers while checking the price of computer parts on their store. 

`Coming soon... Why viraindo design is bad`
